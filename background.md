## Benefits of the Advice Process

> “The more decisions I make, the less engaged others become, and the less ownership they had in the results”

_Dennis Bakke_

All this AP business would seem a lot of effort, if there weren’t significant benefits to putting such a process in place. Thankfully, there are. Here’s a rundown.

**Collaboration**

* Everyone becomes more engaged: people feel more ownership when their advice is sought. Even if their advice isn't followed, at least they feel heard and part of the process.
* When decisions involve more people who are fully engaged, an organisation has a higher chance of a good outcome than it does with a conventional top-down approach, thanks to greater levels of buy-in.

**Accountability**

* When decisions are made by the people who are closest to the problem, they understand the context. Another factor in increasing the likelihood of success of an initiative.
* With full accountability comes ownership; people are more inclined to work towards the success of the project, as if it were their own. 

**Transparency**

* Transparency ensures the process is self-policing – if you’re worried about what other people might think about your decision, then perhaps it's not such a great decision \(or demands further consideration\). 
* It’s harder to not give the advice process its proper attention when others are looking in.
* Transparency is a prerequisite to ensure we don’t descend into chaos. Where decisions have wide impact, a visible decision-making process helps those impacted to understand what/how/why something is happening. 
* Transparency aligns decision making in terms of consistency, in the absence of a central decision-making authority.     
* Transparency helps people learn how to make better decisions \(especially if we come back to decisions retrospectively to record the results\). This is the point of the advice process, to help people become better decision makers on management-like decisions.
* Transparency provides a wider organisational context, helping to reduce waste and providing the platform to make better decisions.  

**Feedback and Learning**

* Decisions that are made by people who are closest to the action receive faster feedback on the outcome, therefore providing a faster learning loop. 
* The AP provides ongoing on-the-job education – no training can match real-world experience.

## When to use the Advice Process

**Using the Advice Process is all about managing change. So if you’re trying to change something in the organisation, you should consider using the AP.**

If you’re **making a decision that someone else should know about**, consider using the Advice Process.

If you are **trying something for the first time**, consider using the Advice Process. The AP helps us learn, both as individuals and as an organisation. If you want to do something that you’ve not seen done before at EE, or is not considered business-as-usual within the company, consider using the AP. It might seem like a very familiar decision for you, but it’s not just about you; it’s about helping the rest of EE learn.

The AP improves communication and transparency, and clarifies accountability. Ultimately we’d like to see the AP become our **preferred form of communicating any decisions**.

The Advice Process should add value, not bureaucracy. If you’re making a decision and don’t see any way the AP will create value – from anyone’s perspective – then don’t use it. If you’re not sure, ask. If you’re still not sure, try. The downside is low, the upside high.

So let’s experiment!

## The principles to get behind

There are some key principles and assumptions that underpin the Advice Process – and they run counter to traditional corporate models. It’s important that you \(and your colleagues!\) buy into these if the Advice Process is to succeed.

You need to believe that people are:

* Grown-ups and want to be treated as such.
* Care about doing the right thing for the company.
* Capable of providing insights and perspectives.
* Capable of making decisions.
* Unique and creative thinkers.
* Capable of learning, and up for a challenge.

Let’s be honest – in some organisations, these are not concepts that would be difficult to embed. We were fortunate at Equal Experts in that we have long encouraged this kind of thinking; our co-founder Thomas de Cad’oro Granier has long expressed a desire for EE to be a ‘company of grown-ups’, an attitude that naturally dovetails with the kind of thinking above.

Whilst many large companies will talk about similar principles, the proof is in how they are executed. They need to be the reality if the AP is to work.

**Pro tips:**

* People aren’t perfect – we are all fallible, no matter where we fall in the hierarchy or how long we’ve been within the organisation.
* It’s hard to let go as a boss and trust and empower people. Do not underestimate how easy it is to slip back into the old ways
